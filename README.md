# chicken-
Being a food lover I like to enjoy other countries’ cuisines too. Sometimes I flavor meals at any halal cafeteria. Belcafe is a restaurant where halal cuisines are feasible. This buffet is near me in the centrum area They offer burgers of various savory like beef, chicken, fish, and cheese. They also have chicken wings, shoarma, kababs, and other many varieties of refreshments on their menus. The most specific part of this cafe is ‘the buffet’ which has varieties of salads, cheese, breads, fish feed, salami, semolina bread, tea, and juice.
